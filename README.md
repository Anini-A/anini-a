# How I built my website and hosted for free? ðŸš€

1. Watched AlexTheAnalyst YT video: [How to create a portfolio website for free](https://youtu.be/ocdwh0KYeUs)
2. Download this website [template](https://html5up.net/dimension) on [HTML5 UP](html5up.net)
3. Download [Brackets](https://brackets.io/) (It is simple and allows live HTML, CSS and JavaScript editing)
4. Redesigned extensively the 'Me' and 'Projects' tab
5. Created a github repository
6. Uploaded all the website files using drag & drop to the repo
7. Followed the steps [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site) to launch the site on Githup Pages ðŸš€

Dimension by HTML5 UP

Free for personal and commercial use under the CCA 3.0 license (html5up.net/license)

This is Dimension, a fun little one-pager with modal-ized (is that a word?) "pages"
and a cool depth effect (click on a menu item to see what I mean). Simple, fully
responsive, and kitted out with all the usual pre-styled elements you'd expect.
Hope you dig it :)
